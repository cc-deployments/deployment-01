# TODO: Privy Integration & Testing

1. **Get the public URL for `privy-logo.png`**
   - Start your Next.js app (`npm run dev`)
   - (If needed) Start localtunnel (`lt --port 3000`)
   - Visit the localtunnel URL (e.g., `https://your-tunnel.loca.lt/privy-logo.png`) to confirm the logo is accessible

2. **Add the logo URL to your Privy dashboard**
   - Go to [Privy dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/)
   - Update the branding/logo URL to your public logo URL

3. **Complete and test Privy integration**
   - Test login/logout flow in your app
   - Make sure Privy modal shows your custom logo and works as expected

4. **(Optional) Review and clean up any remaining Privy-related code or settings**
