# Cloudflare Backend Setup for CarMania

## Overview
This setup creates a Cloudflare Workers backend with D1 database, KV storage, and R2 object storage for the CarMania MiniApp.

## Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account (you're already logged in)
- Wrangler CLI installed (`npm install -g wrangler`)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create D1 Database
```bash
# Create the database
wrangler d1 create carmania-db

# This will output a database ID - copy it and update wrangler.toml
```

### 2. Create KV Namespace
```bash
# Create KV namespace for caching
wrangler kv:namespace create "CARMANIA_CACHE"

# This will output a namespace ID - copy it and update wrangler.toml
```

### 3. Create R2 Bucket
```bash
# Create R2 bucket for storage
wrangler r2 bucket create carmania-storage
```

### 4. Update Configuration
1. Open `wrangler.toml`
2. Replace `your-database-id-here` with the actual D1 database ID
3. Replace `your-kv-id-here` with the actual KV namespace ID

### 5. Initialize Database
```bash
# Apply the database schema
wrangler d1 execute carmania-db --file=./schema.sql
```

### 6. Deploy Worker
```bash
# Deploy the worker
npm run deploy:worker
```

## API Endpoints

### Cars
- `GET /api/cars` - Get all cars
- `GET /api/cars/active` - Get active car
- `POST /api/cars` - Create new car
- `PUT /api/cars/:id` - Update car
- `DELETE /api/cars/:id` - Delete car

### Mints
- `POST /api/mints` - Record mint transaction

## Environment Variables
The worker uses these bindings:
- `DB` - D1 database for car and user data
- `CACHE` - KV namespace for caching
- `STORAGE` - R2 bucket for file storage

## Local Development
```bash
# Start local development server
npm run dev:worker
```

## Integration with MiniApp
Update your MiniApp components to use these API endpoints instead of localStorage.

## Security Notes
- CORS is enabled for all origins (update for production)
- No authentication implemented (add as needed)
- Consider adding rate limiting for production 

## **How to Access Your Live Worker**

Now that you've enabled the workers.dev route, your Worker should be accessible at a URL like:

```
https://carculture-miniapp-backend.<your-account>.workers.dev
```

- `<your-account>` is usually your Cloudflare account's chosen subdomain (sometimes your account name or email prefix).
- You can find the exact public URL in the "Domains & Routes" section of your Worker's settings, right next to the "Enable" button you clicked.

### **What to Do Next**

1. **Look for the full workers.dev URL in the dashboard.**
   - It should be listed under "Domains & Routes" after you enabled it.
   - It will look something like:  
     `https://carculture-miniapp-backend.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`

2. **Copy and visit that URL in your browser.**
   - Try appending `/api/cars` to test your API endpoint:  
     `https://carculture-miniapp-backend.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/api/cars`

3. **If you get a response, your backend is live!**

**If you're not sure what your workers.dev subdomain is, let me know what you see in the "Domains & Routes" section after enabling, and I'll help you find the exact URL.**

You're almost doneâ€”let me know what you see or if you need help finding your public Worker URL!
