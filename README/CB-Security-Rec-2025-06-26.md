# CB Security Recommendation Implementation Summary (2025-06-26)

## Summary of Security Changes Implemented

**1. Wallet Authentication**
- OnchainKit wallet components (`WalletAuth`, `ConnectWallet`) implemented for secure user authentication.
- **Note**: OnchainKit is Coinbase's recommended authentication solution, providing better integration with Coinbase ecosystem.

**2. Server-Side Validation**
- Protected endpoints structured for server-side validation using OnchainKit's `useAuthenticate` hook.
- Custom Farcaster authentication with Redis session management.

**3. Context Data for Lightweight Auth**
- Used for analytics and non-sensitive gating, not as the sole security method.

**4. Rate Limiting**
- In-memory rate limiting per FID implemented on protected endpoints.

**5. Input Validation**
- All inputs to protected endpoints validated and sanitized using zod.

**6. Environment Variables**
- Only required secrets are in `.env.local` and `.env.example` (no unused or sensitive data in code).

**7. HTTPS & Security Headers**
- Security headers (`X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`) set in `next.config.js`.

## Authentication Implementation Status

### ✅ **Main App (carculture-miniapp)**
- **OnchainKit Authentication**: Properly implemented with `@coinbase/onchainkit`
- **Farcaster Integration**: Custom auth with Redis sessions
- **Security**: Follows Coinbase best practices

### ⚠️ **neynar_v2 (Separate Project)**
- **Privy Implementation**: Incomplete - missing Farcaster login method configuration
- **Status**: Not following [Privy Farcaster docs](https://docs.privy.io/authentication/user-authentication/login-methods/farcaster)
- **Recommendation**: Either complete Privy implementation or migrate to OnchainKit for consistency

---

## Important Security Considerations
- **Context Data Limitations:** Context data can be spoofed; do not use as sole security for sensitive content.
- **Authentication Timing:** Only prompt users for authentication when accessing protected features/content.
- **Coinbase Alignment:** OnchainKit provides better integration with Coinbase ecosystem post-Stripe acquisition of Privy.

# TODO for 2025-06-27

1. **Test the existing app locally**
   - Ensure all recent security changes did not break functionality.
   - Focus on SPLASH PAGE and NFTMINTCARD components.

2. **Authentication Strategy Decision**
   - **Option A**: Complete Privy implementation in neynar_v2 following official docs
   - **Option B**: Migrate neynar_v2 to OnchainKit for consistency with main app
   - **Recommendation**: Option B for better Coinbase ecosystem alignment

3. **NFT Minting**
   - Await response from Reservoir partnership (Typescript form submission, Discord follow-up).
   - If no response, evaluate using Manifold contract or alternative solutions for NFT minting.

4. **Prepare for AgentKit Integration**
   - Review AgentKit documentation and requirements.
   - Plan for increased security and possible server-side signature validation.

5. **Monitor Discord/Community**
   - Watch for updates on Reservoir TGE and write-a-thon.
   - Consider participating in the write-a-thon if relevant.

6. **General**
   - Review any new Discord posts for actionable items or partnership opportunities.
