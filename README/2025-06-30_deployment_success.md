# Deployment Success Log â€” 2025-06-30 [PR: Add shared auth guard rail]

## What We Accomplished Today

- **Resolved Monorepo Build Issues:**
  - Ensured Vercel project root was set to `coinbase/fc-minikit`.
  - Set build command to `npm run build` and install command to `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
  - Verified correct Next.js and monorepo settings.

- **Fixed Dependency Problems:**
  - Added `@privy-io/react-auth` to the `fc-minikit` workspace using the correct monorepo install command.
  - Committed and pushed both `coinbase/fc-minikit/package.json` and the root `package-lock.json`.
  - Confirmed dependency was present on GitHub and in Vercel builds.

- **Successful Vercel Deployment:**
  - Waited for the correct commit (`1a3e1bf`) to build and deploy.
  - Verified the app is live at: https://web3-social-starter-fc-minikit.vercel.app
  - UI and all routes are working as expected.

- **Monorepo Best Practices:**
  - All dependency management and installs are now done from the monorepo root using the `-w` flag for workspaces.
  - Confirmed that Vercel builds only the intended app and uses the correct lockfile.

## Next Steps / TODO

- **Add a SHARE button** to the app for easy sharing.
- **Test all features in production:**
  - Wallet connect
  - Notifications
  - Splash screen in Farcaster Mini App Debug Tool
- **Clean up Vercel projects** (optional):
  - Disable or remove unused preview/legacy projects.
- **Continue customizing and refining the app.**
