# Question for BASE AI: Swipe Gesture Implementation in Farcaster Mini App

## Current Implementation Status:
- ✅ **SDK Initialization**: Correctly implemented with `sdk.actions.ready({ disableNativeGestures: true })`
- ✅ **Swipe Handlers**: Using `react-swipeable` with proper event handlers
- ✅ **Manifest**: Properly configured with splash screen settings
- ✅ **App Compiling**: Successfully compiling locally

## Current Issues:
1. **Mobile swipe gestures not working** - can't navigate off gallery-hero page
2. **Vercel deployment showing "Loading..."** on black background
3. **401 Unauthorized errors** from Coinbase services in console
4. **Runtime errors** preventing full app loading

## Question for BASE AI:

**Our Farcaster Mini App has correctly implemented `sdk.actions.ready({ disableNativeGestures: true })` and `react-swipeable` handlers, but mobile swipe gestures are still not working. The app compiles successfully and renders locally, but:**

1. **Why aren't swipe gestures working on mobile despite proper SDK initialization?**
2. **Are the 401 errors from Coinbase services blocking the SDK from fully initializing?**
3. **Should we implement additional fallback gesture handling when SDK fails?**
4. **What's the correct debugging sequence: fix 401 errors first, or focus on gesture conflicts?**

**Current SDK Implementation:**
```ts
await sdk.actions.ready({ disableNativeGestures: true });
```

**Current Swipe Handlers:**
```tsx
const handlers = useSwipeable({
  onSwipedUp: async () => {
    console.log('⬆️ Swipe up detected');
    openUrl('/gallery-hero-2');
  },
  // ... other handlers
});
```

**Expected Behavior:** Swipe up should navigate to next page
**Actual Behavior:** No swipe response on mobile devices

What is the correct approach to resolve this?
