# Question for BASE AI: Gray Page in Farcaster Preview Tool

## The Issue
We've successfully migrated our Mini App to MiniKit-only architecture and deployed to Vercel. However, in Farcaster's Preview Tool:

1. **App opens** - Mini App loads in the preview window
2. **Gray page** - Instead of showing our car gallery content
3. **No content visible** - Just a gray screen with three dots menu

## Farcaster Documentation Says
The [Farcaster Mini Apps documentation](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/getting-started#making-your-app-display) states:

> **Important**: If you don't call `ready()`, users will see an infinite loading screen. This is one of the most common issues when building Mini Apps.

And requires:
```javascript
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'
await sdk.actions.ready()
```

## Our Current Setup
- **MiniKit-only architecture** (as recommended by Base documentation)
- **Removed `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk`** completely
- **Using `setFrameReady()`** from MiniKit instead
- **App works in localhost** but shows gray page in Farcaster Preview Tool

## The Question
**Do we need to add back the Farcaster SDK just for the `sdk.actions.ready()` call?**

### Options:
1. **Add back Farcaster SDK** - Install `@farcaster/miniapp-sdk` and call `sdk.actions.ready()` alongside MiniKit's `setFrameReady()`
2. **Keep MiniKit-only** - The gray page might be a Preview Tool limitation, not a real issue
3. **Test in actual Farcaster app** - Skip Preview Tool and test in the real Farcaster app

## What should we do?
- Is the gray page expected in Preview Tool when using MiniKit-only?
- Should we add back Farcaster SDK just for the `ready()` call?
- Is this a Preview Tool limitation or a real functionality issue?

**Goal**: Determine the correct approach for Farcaster compatibility while maintaining Base App compatibility.
