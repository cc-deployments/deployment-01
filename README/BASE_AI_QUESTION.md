# Question for BASE AI: Vercel Loading Issue with Farcaster Mini App

## Problem Description
Our Farcaster Mini App works perfectly locally but shows a black screen with "Loading..." on Vercel deployment. The app uses MiniKit hooks exclusively and has proper splash screen timing.

## Current Setup
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Mini App Library**: MiniKit (`@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit`)
- **Hook Usage**: Only MiniKit hooks (no direct Farcaster SDK calls)
- **Splash Screen**: Proper timing with `imageLoaded` and `sdkReady` states

## Key Files
1. **Main Page**: `app/gallery-hero/page.tsx` - Uses `useOpenUrl` from MiniKit
2. **Safe Area Hook**: `hooks/useSafeArea.ts` - Currently returns hardcoded values
3. **Providers**: `app/providers.tsx` - MiniKit and Farcaster context providers
4. **Layout**: `app/layout.tsx` - Contains Farcaster Mini App meta tag

## Current State
- ✅ Local development works perfectly
- ✅ Build succeeds on Vercel (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- ✅ App renders correctly in some browser contexts
- ❌ Vercel preview shows black screen with "Loading..."
- ❌ Safe area insets are all zeros: `{ top: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0 }`

## Suspected Issues
1. **Safe Area Hook**: The `useSafeArea` hook might be causing the loading state
2. **MiniKit Initialization**: MiniKit hooks might not initialize properly on Vercel
3. **Environment Detection**: Different behavior between local and production environments
4. **Splash Screen Timing**: `sdk.actions.ready()` timing might be off in production

## Questions for BASE AI
1. **Safe Area Necessity**: Do we need safe area calculations for buttons positioned within a fixed container (1260px × 2400px)?
2. **MiniKit Production Issues**: Are there known issues with MiniKit hooks in Vercel production environments?
3. **Loading State Diagnosis**: What could cause a "Loading..." state that persists in production but not locally?
4. **Environment-Specific Fixes**: What are the best practices for ensuring MiniKit compatibility across different deployment environments?
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Should we remove the safe area dependency entirely since buttons use fixed positioning?

## Code Context
The app uses percentage-based button positioning and doesn't rely on device-specific safe areas. The `useSafeArea` hook might be unnecessary overhead causing the loading issues.

**Can BASE AI help diagnose why the app gets stuck in a loading state on Vercel despite working locally?**
