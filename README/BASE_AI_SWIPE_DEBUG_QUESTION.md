# Question for BASE AI: Swipe Gestures Not Working in Mini App

## Current Status
Our Mini App has the following functionality:
- ✅ **App loads correctly** - No errors, proper rendering
- ✅ **Test button works** - Click events function properly
- ✅ **Arrow key navigation works** - Keyboard navigation functional
- ❌ **Swipe gestures not working** - No response to touch/swipe

## Technical Details

### Current Implementation
```tsx
const handlers = useSwipeable({
  onSwipedUp: async () => {
    console.log('⬆️ Swipe up detected - navigating to gallery-hero-2');
    openUrl('/gallery-hero-2');
  },
  onSwipedDown: async () => {
    console.log('⬇️ Swipe down detected - navigating to text-page');
    openUrl('/text-page');
  },
  trackMouse: true,
  delta: 30,
  swipeDuration: 400,
  preventScrollOnSwipe: true,
  trackTouch: true,
  rotationAngle: 0,
  touchEventOptions: { passive: false },
});
```

### Container Setup
```tsx
<div 
  {...handlers} 
  style={{
    touchAction: 'pan-y',
    userSelect: 'none',
    WebkitUserSelect: 'none',
    WebkitTouchCallout: 'none',
  }}
>
```

## The Problem
- **Touch events work** - Test button responds to clicks
- **Swipe events don't** - No console logs from swipe handlers
- **No errors** - App loads without issues
- **react-swipeable not firing** - Handlers never called

## Questions for BASE AI

### 1. **Why aren't swipe gestures working?**
- Is there a conflict with MiniKit's gesture handling?
- Should we use different swipe detection?
- Are there known issues with `react-swipeable` in Mini Apps?

### 2. **What's the recommended approach?**
- Should we use native touch events instead?
- Is there a MiniKit-specific swipe solution?
- Should we implement custom swipe detection?

### 3. **Debugging steps?**
- How to verify if `react-swipeable` is properly initialized?
- What console logs should we see for swipe events?
- Are there environment-specific issues (localhost vs production)?

### 4. **Alternative solutions?**
- Use `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd` directly?
- Implement custom swipe detection?
- Use a different swipe library?

## Context
- **MiniKit-only architecture** (as recommended)
- **App works in localhost** - All other functionality working
- **No errors in console** - Clean execution
- **Touch events functional** - Button clicks work

## What's the correct approach to fix swipe gestures in our Mini App?
