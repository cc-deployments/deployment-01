# 🚗 NFT Car Chat Expert - Pilot Architecture

**Project:** Car Recognition & Customer Engagement System  
**Status:** Pilot Phase - Ready for Social Media Testing  
**Date:** 2025-06-15

## 🏗️ **Current Tech Stack**

### **Frontend:**
- Gradio web interface with voice support
- Mobile-friendly design
- Real-time chat interaction
- Image upload capabilities

### **AI Models (Priority Order):**
1. **Primary:** Your custom trained CarVIT model (944MB) from `./car_recognition_model_local`
2. **Fallback 1:** Your trained chat model (475MB) from `./simple_car_chat_model`
3. **Alternative:** Takekazuchi/Caracam model (for testing/comparison)
4. **Fallback 2:** Generic CarVIT (`abdusah/CarViT`)
5. **Last Resort:** Generic BLIP (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)

### **Data Architecture:**
- **Multi-chunk JSON system** (scales to 50TB)
- **Current:** 208 records from 2 JSON files
  - `final_corrected_2025-06-08.json` (43 records)
  - `annotations_corrected_2025-06-15.json` (165 records)
- **UUID-mapped dataset** with 184 training samples
- **Filename preservation** for exact matching

### **Search & Recognition:**
- Direct car lookup by filename/UUID
- Image similarity matching with MSE comparison
- Conversational keyword matching
- Debugging infrastructure with detailed logging

## 📊 **Data Flow Architecture**

```
Customer Upload → Your CarVIT Model → Direct Search → Conversational Response
                           ↓
                    Image Similarity → Multi-JSON Lookup → Customer Engagement
                           ↓
                    Debug Logging → Performance Monitoring
```

## 🔧 **Current Capabilities**
