## üéØ **RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **Start with Phase 1 (Environment Configuration):**
- **Why:** Foundation for everything else
- **Risk:** Low - just centralizing existing config
- **Benefit:** Immediate type safety and consistency
- **Time:** 1-2 hours

### **Then Phase 2 (Shared Auth):**
- **Why:** Required for UI components
- **Risk:** Medium - affects authentication flow
- **Benefit:** Unified auth across all apps
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### **Then Phase 3 (Shared UI):**
- **Why:** Builds on shared auth
- **Risk:** Medium - affects user interface
- **Benefit:** Reusable components
- **Time:** 2-3 hours

### **Then Phase 4 (App Integration):**
- **Why:** Uses all previous work
- **Risk:** High - affects all apps
- **Benefit:** Complete architecture
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

### **Finally Phase 5 (Layout Optimization):**
- **Why:** Optimizes the complete system
- **Risk:** Low - just optimization
- **Benefit:** Best development experience
- **Time:** 1-2 hours
