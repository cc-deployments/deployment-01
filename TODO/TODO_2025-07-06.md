# TODO - 2025-07-06: CarMania Garage Development

## Carryover from Yesterday
- [ ] Update @farcaster/frame-sdk to latest version (0.1.2) across the monorepo and resolve any dependency conflicts
- [ ] Implement swipe-up navigation between hero and secondary gallery images
- [ ] On first swipe up: show carmania-gallery-hero-2.png
- [ ] On tap of secondary gallery: direct to Car of the Day mint page (https://app.manifold.xyz/c/man-driving-car)
- [ ] On second swipe up: direct to Manifold gallery (https://manifold.xyz/@carculture)
- [ ] Add swipe/tap gesture handling (consider react-swipeable)
- [ ] Test on mobile and desktop

## Today's Priorities
- [ ] Review current app deployment status on Vercel
- [ ] Verify manifest submission with Farcaster (check if domain is correctly configured)
- [ ] Test the "Mint Car of the Day" button functionality and styling
- [ ] Check if any dependency conflicts need resolution after SDK update
- [ ] Review and update documentation as needed

## Notes
- App: CarCulture: CarMania Garage
- Current domain: [check Vercel deployment]
- Button styling: Lozenge with #a32428 brand color, 60px font size
- Hero image: carmania-gallery-hero.png
- Secondary image: carmania-gallery-hero-2.png

## Manifest Submission Checklist (additions)
- [ ] Test notification system end-to-end (send, receive, display)
- [ ] Share app with another user and verify onboarding, wallet, and mint flow

## Navigation & Scrolling UX Opportunities (for future reference)
- Vertical swipe: Hero <-> Gallery 2
- Horizontal swipe: Carousel between images (optionally to Manifold gallery)
- Tap: Mint page
- Button: Always visible, opens mint page
- Visual indicators for current image (dots/arrows)
- Add "View Gallery" button on Gallery 2
- Add "Subscribe" (Paragraph) after wallet creation or mint
- Add "Fund Wallet" instructions after wallet creation
- Social sharing after mint
- Hybrid navigation (support both vertical and horizontal swipes)
