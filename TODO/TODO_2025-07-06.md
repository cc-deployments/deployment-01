# TODO - 2025-07-06: CarMania Garage Development

## Carryover from Yesterday
- [ ] Implement swipe-up navigation between hero and secondary gallery images
- [ ] On first swipe up: show carmania-gallery-hero-2.png
- [ ] On tap of secondary gallery: direct to Car of the Day mint page (https://app.manifold.xyz/c/man-driving-car)
- [ ] On second swipe up: direct to Manifold gallery (https://manifold.xyz/@carculture)
- [ ] Add swipe/tap gesture handling (consider react-swipeable)
- [ ] Test on mobile and desktop

## Today's Priorities
- [ ] Review current app deployment status on Vercel
- [ ] Verify manifest submission with Farcaster (check if domain is correctly configured)
- [ ] Test the "Mint Car of the Day" button functionality and styling
- [ ] Review and update documentation as needed

## Notes
- App: CarCulture: CarMania Garage
- Current domain: [check Vercel deployment]
- Button styling: Lozenge with #a32428 brand color, 60px font size
- Hero image: carmania-gallery-hero.png
- Secondary image: carmania-gallery-hero-2.png

## Manifest Submission Checklist (additions)
- [ ] Share app with another user and verify onboarding, wallet, and mint flow
- [ ] **URGENT: Update manifest social share description** - Change to: "Car Culture's CarMania Garage: iconic cars, stories, and featured 'car of the day'" (95 chars)
- [ ] **URGENT: Create social share image (1200x630) for Farcaster manifest** - Current ogImage uses hero.png but needs dedicated social share image with minimal text, clear branding, and exact 1200x630 dimensions
- [ ] **URGENT: Update .env file** - Change NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_OG_DESCRIPTION to "Car Culture's CarMania Garage: iconic cars, stories, and featured 'car of the day'" (95 chars)
- [ ] **URGENT: Update .env file** - Change NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_OG_IMAGE to point to new social share image URL
- [ ] **URGENT: Redeploy to Vercel** - After .env changes to update manifest
- [ ] **URGENT: Update Farcaster manifest submission** - Submit updated manifest with new social share description and image
- [ ] **FIX: Splash background color mismatch** - App uses #a32428 (brand red) but manifest shows #6200EA (purple). Update manifest to use #a32428 to match app configuration.

## Navigation & Scrolling UX Opportunities (for future reference)
- Vertical swipe: Hero <-> Gallery 2
- Horizontal swipe: Carousel between images (optionally to Manifold gallery)
- Tap: Mint page
- Button: Always visible, opens mint page
- Visual indicators for current image (dots/arrows)
- Add "View Gallery" button on Gallery 2

## **URGENT: Fix App Flow - Manifold Studio Profile Integration**
- [ ] **Current Flow Issue:** App only goes to daily mint page, missing Manifold Studio profile
- [ ] **Add Gallery 2 Navigation:** When user taps Gallery 2 image, should go to Manifold Studio profile (https://manifold.xyz/@carculture)
- [ ] **Add "View Full Gallery" Button:** Add button on Gallery 2 that links to Manifold Studio profile
- [ ] **Update Flow:** Hero → Gallery 2 → Manifold Studio Profile (not just daily mint)
- [ ] **Test Complete Flow:** Hero → Gallery 2 → Manifold Studio → Daily Mint
- Add "Subscribe" (Paragraph) after wallet creation or mint
- Add "Fund Wallet" instructions after wallet creation
- Social sharing after mint
- Hybrid navigation (support both vertical and horizontal swipes)
