# TODO - 2024-06-16

## 1. Bankr/Clanker Integration Questions for Meeting
- What is the best way to integrate a Manifold contract (ERC721 and ERC1155, on both Base and Ethereum L1) with a custom minting UI or miniapp, so users can mint directly from our app using Bankr/Clanker's infrastructure?
- Is there a public or recommended JSON/ABI endpoint for Manifold contracts that Bankr/Clanker uses?
- Are there any special requirements for supporting both ERC721 and ERC1155 on Base and L1?
- What is the best practice for handling wallet connection and transaction signing in this flow?
- Is there a way to leverage Bankr/Clanker's distribution on X and Farcaster for our miniapp?
- (Be aware: Manifold and Clanker may consider their solution a competitive advantage and may not share all details.)

## 2. Strategic Considerations
- Should we use the Coinbase NFTCard template for minting, or rely on Clanker/Bankr's infrastructure (which may take a revenue share)?
  - Pros of using CB NFTCard: more control, potentially lower fees, direct integration with Coinbase ecosystem, ability to set custom mint durations, and control over pre-minting and edition sales.
  - Cons: may require more custom development for Manifold contracts, and may not have the same viral/social distribution as Clanker/Bankr.
- Can the NFTCard template be used to sell pre-minted NFTs (editions) through Coinbase? Need to check OnchainKit/CDP API docs for secondary sales or listing pre-minted NFTs.
- With Shopify, Strike, Coinbase, and Privy now aligned, should we consider selling NFTs through Shopify for broader reach and fiat onramps?

## 3. Next Steps
- Test minting with the correct Manifold JSON/ABI.
- Prepare and ask the above questions in the Bankr/Clanker meeting.
- After the meeting, update minting logic and sales strategy based on findings.
- Organize all TODOs in a single TODO folder, with date-stamped filenames. Move completed TODOs to an archive subfolder.

---

**Note:**
- All TODOs must now be placed in the `TODO/` folder and include the date in the filename (e.g., `TODO-2024-06-16.md`).
- Completed TODOs should be moved to `TODO/archive/` for record-keeping and purging.
