## üö® CRITICAL FAILURES - 2025-01-27

### ‚ùå COMPLETE NAVIGATION FAILURE
- [ ] **Swipe gestures completely broken** - react-swipeable not detecting any events
- [ ] **No console logs appearing** - No swipe start/end/progress logs in browser console
- [ ] **Touch events not firing** - Direct touch handlers not working on mobile or desktop
- [ ] **Button interactions dead** - All buttons non-functional across all pages
- [ ] **Navigation flow impossible** - Users cannot move between pages at all

### ‚ùå MINIKIT INTEGRATION ISSUES
- [ ] **setFrameReady not working** - MiniKit readiness signal not functioning
- [ ] **useMiniKit hooks failing** - Context and frame ready state not initializing
- [ ] **disableNativeGestures ignored** - Native gestures still interfering despite setting
- [ ] **Event handlers blocked** - All touch and click events being prevented

### ‚ùå RESPONSIVE CONTAINER PROBLEMS
- [ ] **100vw/100vh causing issues** - Responsive containers may be blocking events
- [ ] **Flexbox centering conflicts** - CSS centering interfering with event detection
- [ ] **Pointer events blocked** - Inner containers still blocking touch events
- [ ] **Overflow hidden preventing interaction** - Container overflow settings blocking events

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - PERSISTENT ERRORS

### ‚ùå COMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE
- [ ] **No swipe detection at all** - react-swipeable library completely non-functional
- [ ] **No button interactions** - All onClick and touch handlers dead
- [ ] **No console feedback** - No event logs appearing in browser console
- [ ] **No MiniKit integration** - useMiniKit hooks not providing expected functionality
- [ ] **No navigation possible** - Users completely stuck on single pages

### üîß TECHNICAL DEBT
- [ ] **COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED**: Current approach has completely failed - need new strategy
- [ ] **MINIKIT INVESTIGATION**: Determine if MiniKit is the right approach or if we need different SDK
- [ ] **EVENT HANDLER DEBUGGING**: Why are all touch and click events completely dead?
- [ ] **CONTAINER ARCHITECTURE**: Responsive containers may be fundamentally incompatible with event handling

## üìã COMPLETED TASKS
- [x] **Removed Farcaster SDK**: Completely eliminated @farcaster/miniapp-sdk to resolve conflicts
- [x] **Implemented MiniKit-only architecture**: Using only @coinbase/onchainkit/minikit as recommended
- [x] **Fixed container overflow**: Changed from fixed dimensions to responsive 100vw/100vh
- [x] **Fixed syntax errors**: Resolved JSON meta content issues in layout.tsx
- [x] **Pushed to repository**: All changes committed and pushed to main branch

## üéØ NEXT PRIORITY
1. **COMPLETE REWRITE STRATEGY** - Current approach has completely failed
2. **INVESTIGATE ALTERNATIVE SDKS** - MiniKit may not be the right solution
3. **DEBUG EVENT HANDLERS** - Why are all touch and click events completely dead?
4. **TEST BASIC FUNCTIONALITY** - Start with simple button clicks before complex swipe gestures

## üìù ERROR PATTERNS
- **Desktop**: No functionality at all - buttons dead, swipe dead
- **Mobile**: No functionality at all - buttons dead, swipe dead  
- **Touch Events**: Completely non-functional - no events firing at all
- **Console**: No logs appearing - event handlers not even being called

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27 - Complete functionality failure after SDK removal and responsive container changes

## üéØ NEXT PRIORITY TASKS (2025-01-27)

### üîß CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED
- [ ] **COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED** - Current architecture has completely failed
- [ ] **RESTORE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY** - Start with simple button clicks before complex features
- [ ] **INVESTIGATE MINIKIT ALTERNATIVES** - Consider different SDK or approach
- [ ] **DEBUG EVENT HANDLERS** - Why are all touch and click events completely dead?
- [ ] **TEST ON ACTUAL DEVICE** - Verify if the problem is localhost or universal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES - ACCEPTABLE
- [ ] **Minor delay on manifold-gallery loading** - Small pause due to `await sdk.context` check (acceptable for production)
- [ ] **SDK context check delay** - ~100-200ms delay before redirect (minimal impact)
