# TODO - 2025-07-10: CarMania Garage Development

## Tasks
- [ ] Improve app navigation (swipe, tap, and button flows)
- [ ] Configure and test Manifold Gallery integration (gallery display, mint links, profile connection)

## Notes
- Review all UI/UX changes from previous days
- Ensure all branding and color updates are consistent
- Test on both desktop and mobile 
- **2025-07-14:** Testing led to the summary table decision (see assistant notes). We are redirecting `/` to `/gallery-hero` for focused UX testing.

### Overlay Responsive Positioning (for future experiments)
- Try overlay top: 80% and height: 15%
- If not visible, try top: 85% and height: 10%
- Optionally try top: 75% and height: 20%
- Adjust as needed for best mobile/desktop balance
