# TODO - 2025-06-24

## Progress & Actions

- Resolved Vercel deployment issue with HeartbeatWorker.js (ESM/webpack fix)
- Updated splash page to use Forward.png as default image
- Admin backend tested and working for local car NFT management
- Clarified localStorage limitations for production
- Discussed backend options: GraphQL/Postgres, Arweave, Cloudflare
- Confirmed Ngrok is for tunneling, not a backend
- Cloudflare is a strong candidate for serverless backend, storage, and API
- All local and admin data loaded and tested

## Next Steps
- Decide on backend: Cloudflare D1/Workers, Hasura, Supabase, or custom GraphQL
- Integrate backend with MiniApp and Admin
- Move NFT/AI metadata to Arweave for permanence
- Prepare for production deployment
- Upgrade Next.js if needed
- Continue testing and refining user/admin flows
