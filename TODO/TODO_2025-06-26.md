# TODO â€“ 2024-07-01

## Focus for Tomorrow

### 1. UI/UX Improvements
- Review and refine the CarCulture Miniapp UI for clarity and user engagement
- Remove or update any legacy wallet connection buttons (e.g., OnchainKit vs. Privy)
- Ensure gallery and minting flows are intuitive and visually appealing
- Test on multiple devices and browsers

### 2. Manifold Integration
- Integrate Manifold contracts for NFT minting
- Test minting flow end-to-end (from UI to contract interaction)
- Ensure contract addresses and ABIs are correctly referenced in the miniapp
- Add error handling and user feedback for minting actions

### 3. Codebase Cleanup & Refactor
- Remove or archive any deprecated directories (e.g., old gallery, neynar_v2)
- Ensure all shared logic is imported from the new shared/identity/ location
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Open Questions/Blockers
- Await feedback from Sohey (CB MiniKit dev) on best practices for OnchainKit/Privy and monorepo structure
- Confirm approach for edge/Apple app support and future AI/agent integration
