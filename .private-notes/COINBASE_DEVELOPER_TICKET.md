## Issue Type: Base Pay Integration Support

### Subject: Base Pay Implementation - Need Technical Support for Production Deployment

### Description:

We have successfully implemented Base Pay in our application using the `@base-org/account` SDK (v2.0.2) and need technical support for production deployment and best practices.

### Implementation Details:

**Package**: `@base-org/account@^2.0.2`
**Framework**: React with TypeScript
**Integration**: Wagmi + Base Pay (working alongside wallet connections)

### Current Status:
✅ **Working Implementation**: Base Pay is fully integrated and functional
✅ **Testnet Testing**: Successfully processing testnet payments
✅ **UI Components**: Complete React components (BasePayButton, BasePayModal)
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
✅ **Documentation**: Full implementation documentation

### Questions/Support Needed:

1. **Production Deployment**: Best practices for moving from testnet to mainnet
2. **Payment Validation**: Server-side payment verification recommendations
3. **Rate Limits**: Any API rate limits or usage guidelines
4. **Monitoring**: Recommended monitoring and analytics for payment flows
5. **Security**: Additional security considerations for production
6. **Support**: Official support channels for Base Pay issues

### Code Example:
```typescript
import { pay } from '@base-org/account';

const result = await pay({
  amount: '5.00',
  to: '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6',
  testnet: false, // Ready for mainnet
  payerInfo: {
    email: true,
    name: true,
  },
});
```

### Environment:
- **Development**: Base Sepolia testnet ✅
- **Production**: Base mainnet (pending guidance)
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Wallet Integration**: Wagmi v2.15.6

### Additional Context:
