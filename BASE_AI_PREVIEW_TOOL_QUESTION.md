# Question for BASE AI: Farcaster Preview Tool Functionality

## The Situation
We've successfully migrated our Mini App to MiniKit-only architecture and deployed it to Vercel. When testing in Farcaster's Preview Tool:

1. **App opens** - Mini App loads in the preview window
2. **Gray page** - Instead of showing our car gallery content
3. **Limited interaction** - Only see three dots menu with "Reload page" and "Switch wallet"

## Our Questions

### 1. **What should we expect from Farcaster's Preview Tool?**
- Does it show the full Mini App interface?
- Can we test swipe navigation within the preview?
- Should we see our car gallery images?
- Is it just a basic "does it load" test?

### 2. **Is the gray page normal?**
- Is this expected behavior in Preview Tool?
- Should we see our actual app content?
- Are there known limitations of the Preview Tool?

### 3. **How do we properly test Mini App functionality?**
- Should we test in the actual Farcaster app instead?
- Is Preview Tool just for basic loading validation?
- What's the recommended testing approach?

### 4. **What does "success" look like in Preview Tool?**
- Just that the app opens without crashing?
- Should we see our actual UI?
- Can we test navigation and interactions?

## Context
- MiniKit-only architecture (as recommended)
- Deployed to Vercel successfully
- App works in localhost
- Preview Tool opens but shows gray page
- No error messages visible

## What should we expect from Farcaster's Preview Tool, and how should we properly test our Mini App functionality?

**Goal**: Understand the proper testing workflow for Mini Apps in Farcaster's development environment.
