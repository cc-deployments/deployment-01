Status and Disposition of Claims
Applicant amends independent claim 1 to clarify certain elements and/or limitations.  Applicant amends independent claim 11 to further define structure of the method thereof.  Dependent claims 3-4, 7, and 10 have been amended to clarify certain elements and/or limitations.  Dependent claim 8 has been amended to clarify characteristics of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the authenticated and verified data.  Claims 2, 5-6, 8-9, and 12-20 are presented as originally filed.  Therefore, claims 1-20 remain pending in this case.  Please reconsider the application and claim amendments in view of the following remarks.
Claim Rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 112
Claims 1-10 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 112(b) as allegedly being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor regards as the invention.  Applicant respectfully traverses.  First, regarding claim 1, the Office alleges that “the object” in the phrase “at least one objection in a data object comprising at least a portion of the object to be classified” allegedly lacks antecedent basis.  Applicant amends claim 1 herewith to clarify that “the data object comprises at least a portion of the at least one object to be classified”.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Second, regarding claim 1, the Office alleges that “the trained neural network” lack antecedent basis.  Applicant amends accordingly.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Third, regarding claim 3, the Office alleges that “the authentication data” lacks antecedent basis.  Applicant amends by striking reference to the article “the”.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Fourth, regarding claim 4, the Office alleges that “the verification data” lacks antecedent basis.  Applicant amends by striking reference to the article “the”.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Fifth, regarding claim 4, the Offices alleges that the limitation “The method of claim 1, wherein the verification data comprises one or more of a unique digital object identifier, a hash of the metadata together with a signature or a claim” is indefinite.  Applicant amends by clarifying that claim 4 establishes that claim 4 may refer to permutations of three distinction subsets.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Sixth, regarding claim 7, the Offices alleges that “the data” lacks antecedent basis.  Applicant amends the same to specify “data object”.  Support for this amendment may be found, for example, in paragraph [0138] of Applicant’s as-filed specification.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Seventh, regarding claim 7, the Office alleges that “the class” lacks antecedent basis.  Applicant amends by stating that the “data objects form a class” thereby providing the appropriate article.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Eighth, regarding claim 10, the Office alleges that “the training” recited therein lacks antecedent basis.  Applicant amends by specifying that “a secondary training” occurs.  Withdrawal of the rejection is respectfully requested.
Applicant respectfully requests withdrawal of the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112(a) and solicits a notice of allowance thereof.
Claim Rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 101
Claims 10-20 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 101 as allegedly being directed to non-statutory subject matter.  Applicant respectfully traverses.  As a preliminary matter Applicant asserts that the Office intended to reject claims 11-20 under the 101 provision, as claim 10 depends from claim 1 and is therefore not nested within independent claim 11—Applicant requests confirmation to this effect.
Turning to the substance of the rejection and without expressly acquiescing to the merits of the allegation, Applicant amends independent claim 11 to recite that “the neural network being trained according to the method of claim 1”.  Support for this amendment may be found, for example, in FIG. 3 and/or paragraphs [0053]-[0065].  Applicant asserts that claim 11 as amended results in significant technical improvement(s) with respect to training, processing, authenticating, verifying, and/or generating a result above that of a human mental process, and therefore constitutes patentable-eligible subject matter, consistent with MPEP §§ 2106.04-2106.06 and Federal Circuit post-Enfish precedent.  See also: Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2016).
Applicant respectfully requests withdrawal of the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 101 and solicits a notice of allowance thereof.
Claim Rejections under 35 U.S.C. § 103
Claims 1-4 and 7-9 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as allegedly being unpatentable over the combination of U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2020/0133961 A1 to Wroblewski (hereinafter “Wroblewski”) in view of the non-patent literature entitled “A Novel Blockchain-Based Framework for Vehicle Lite Cycle Tracking: An End-to-End Solution" by Toqeer Ali Syed (2020) (hereinafter “Syed”).  Applicant respectfully traverses.
To overcome the rejection, Applicant submits herewith (i) a Petition To Accept Unintentionally-Delayed Claim Of Benefit Of Provisional Application Under 37 C.F.R. § 1.78(c), and (ii) an Affidavit of inventor and owner of Applicant, Automobilia II, LLC (hereinafter, “Lewis Affidavit”).  The Lewis Affidavit is being filed to furnish a statement of facts in conjunction with the amendment to the specification supra, and amended ADS, which together constitute an unintentionally-delayed claim to priority under 37 C.F.R. § 1.78(c) and/or 35 U.S.C. § 119(e).
Applicant asserts that the entire delay between the date the claim was due under 37 C.F.R. § 1.78(a)(4) and the date the claim was filed was unintentional.  Applicant asserts that a change in strategy has occurred with respect to prosecution of the instant application.  See: Lewis Declaration, paragraphs 1-16.
The current legal representative for Applicant, patent attorney Nicholas E. Blanton (Reg. No. 78,975) states that the named inventor, Lucinda LEWIS, (hereafter “inventor Lewis”) firstly operated as a pro se Applicant when filing the provisional dating back to May 9, 2019.  Then, at the time the priority-founding PCT applications were respectively written (PCT/US2021/058576, filed on November 9, 2021; PCT/US2020/032149, filed on May 8, 2020), inventor Lewis did have patent attorney Kristin Nicholes (Reg. No. 56,238) helping her to draft and file the applications.  However, inventor Lewis does not recall having had conversations concerning the strategic implications of a claim to priority between the two patent families, nor the implications of no claim to priority between the latter-filed PCT (from which this application already claims priority) and the former PCT application.  Lewis Declaration, paragraphs 10-12.
By perfecting a claim to priority back to May 9, 2019, Applicant asserts that Syed is predated, and therefore the Office has not made a prima-facie case of obviousness against claim 1, where at least the following is not taught by Wroblewski: “training, by the processor, a neural network for classifying at least one object in a data object comprising at least a portion of the object to be classified, authenticating a data object received by the neural network and verifying the data object received by the neural network, the training using the taxonomy and at least a subset of data objects from the training dataset as inputs to the neural network during the training…”  In the Office’s own characterization of claim 1, at least these elements and/or limitations are not taught by Wroblewski—see Office Action, page 13, paragraph 1, which states in relevant part, “However, Wroblewski does not explicitly teach training, by the processor, a neural network for classifying at least one object in a data object comprising at least a portion of the object to be classified….”
Because the combination of Wroblewski and Syed fail to disclose each and every element and limitation recited in independent claim 1, Applicant submits that claim 1, and the claims dependent from claim 1, are not anticipated by Wroblewski and Syed.  Claims 2-4, and 7-9 are allowable by virtue of their dependency from claim 1.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
The Office rejected claim 5 as allegedly being unpatentable over Wroblewski and Syed, and in further view of Oberhofer, US 2020/0341951 A1, (hereinafter “Oberhofer”).  Applicant respectfully traverses.  Applicant submits that nothing in Oberhofer overcomes the aforementioned argument.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
The Office rejected claim 6 as allegedly being unpatentable over Wroblewski and Syed, and in further view of Newman, US 2020/0074300 A1, (hereinafter “Newman”).  Applicant respectfully traverses.  Applicant submits that, Newman is predated by the instant application, because it has a priority date of August 9, 2019.  Therefore, Newman cannot overcome the aforementioned argument.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
The Office rejected claim 5 as allegedly being unpatentable over Wroblewski and Syed, and in further view of Gupta, US 2020/0065848 A1, (hereinafter “Gupta”).  Applicant respectfully traverses.  Applicant submits that nothing in Gupta overcomes the aforementioned argument.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
The Office rejected claims 11 and 14-18 as allegedly being unpatentable over Syed and Hassani, US 2020/0406859 A1, (hereinafter “Hassani”), and in further view of Tang, US 2020/0341951 A1, (hereinafter “Tang”).  Applicant respectfully traverses.  Applicant submits that, Syed is predated by the instant application, as previously mentioned.  Therefore, Syed cannot overcome the aforementioned argument and Applicant asserts that the Office has not made a prima facie case of obviousness against claim 11.  Claims 14-18 are allowable by virtue of their dependency from claim 11.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
The Office rejected claims 12 and 13 as allegedly being unpatentable over Syed, Hassani, and Tang, and in further view of Shpalensky, US 2019/0259136 A1, (hereinafter “Shpalensky”).  Applicant respectfully traverses.  Applicant submits that nothing in Shpalensky overcomes the aforementioned argument.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
The Office rejected claims 19 and 20 as allegedly being unpatentable over Syed, Hassani, and Tang, and in further view of Newman.  Applicant respectfully traverses.  Applicant submits that nothing in Newman overcomes the aforementioned argument.
Accordingly, Applicant requests that the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 be withdrawn and solicits
a Notice of Allowance thereof.
Conclusion
In view of the foregoing, it is respectfully submitted that claims 1-20, now pending, are patentably distinct from the references cited and are in condition for allowance.  Reconsideration of the application and withdrawal of the rejections of record are respectfully requested.
Applicant submits herewith a one (1) month extension of time fee, as this response to the non-final Office Action dated January 29, 2024 is being filed within four (4) months.  Reconsideration of the application and withdrawal of the rejections of record are respectfully requested.
