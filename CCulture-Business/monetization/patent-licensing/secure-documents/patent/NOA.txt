CRM, and system that include/perform the operations of at least "processing multimodal
input data based upon multimodal and/or multiclass training data, the method

asset received by the CNN, and verify the data object received by the CNN; training, by
a processor, a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the multimodal and/or multiclass
training data; receiving, by the processor, a query comprising input data; classifying, by
the trained CNN, the input data with respect to the authenticated data and elements of
one or more classes of the taxonomy; generating a result, by the trained CNN, wherein
the result comprises authenticated data and elements of one or more classes of the
taxonomy comprising a closest match to the input data; and displaying the result on a
device, wherein the result comprises one or more of an image, a video, text, sound,
augmented reality content, virtual reality content or mixed reality content".
The cited and considered prior art, specifically those cited and relied upon in the
previous Office action(s) as well as the instant Office action, fails to anticipate or render
obvious either alone or in combination with proper motivation the above mentioned
claimed limitations of the instant application in conjunction with the other claimed
limitations as claimed in the instant application, and therefore independent claims 1, 18,
and 20 are allowed.
Claims 2-17 and 19 are allowed for being dependent upon allowed base claims 1
and 18.
