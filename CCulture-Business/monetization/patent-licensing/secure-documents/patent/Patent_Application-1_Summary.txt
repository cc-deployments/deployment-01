Patent Application Summary
=========================

1. Original Patent Application Text
-----------------------------------
- Title: Methods, Systems and Computer Program Products for Media Processing and Display
- Content:
  - Describes an AI-driven system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process, classify, authenticate, and verify media asset data (images, video, text, geolocation, etc.).
  - The system is trained on authenticated/copyrighted data and uses a detailed taxonomy for classification.
  - Applications include vehicle identification, cultural heritage preservation, AR/VR display, and more.
  - The claims cover methods, systems, and computer-readable media for training, classifying, authenticating, verifying, and displaying results using multimodal data.
  - Emphasizes technical improvements, authenticated data, and a feedback loop for user interaction and data enrichment.

2. Patent Drawings
------------------
- FIG. 1: System overview showing data flow from input (media, geolocation, etc.) through CNN/RNN processing to output (classification, display).
- FIG. 2: Detailed CNN architecture, showing layers and processing steps for image data.
- FIG. 3: Method flowchart for training, receiving input, classifying, generating, and displaying results.
- FIG. 4: AR/VR display method, showing steps for capturing, synthesizing, and displaying augmented images.
- FIG. 5: System/network architecture, illustrating secure, modular, cloud-based microservices and data flow.
- FIG. 6: Computational cluster diagram, showing distributed processing for large-scale data.
- FIG. 7: Hardware implementation, detailing the computer system components for executing the invention.
- Purpose: The drawings visually support the claims and specification, clarifying the technical structure and workflow of the invention.

3. Notice of Allowance (NOA)
----------------------------
- Application No.: 17/609,911
- Status: All claims (1-20) are allowed.
- Examiner's Reasoning:
  - The claims are novel and non-obvious over the prior art.
  - The combination of CNN/RNN training, multimodal/multiclass data, authentication, and verification is not taught or suggested by the cited references.
  - The system's ability to process, classify, authenticate, and verify media assets, and display results (including AR/VR content), is recognized as inventive.
- Result: The application is in condition for allowance and will proceed to grant upon payment of the issue fee.

Overall Summary
---------------
- The patent application describes a novel AI-based system for media asset classification, authentication, and display, with a focus on vehicles and cultural heritage.
- The technical details are well-supported by both the written description and the drawings.
- The USPTO has allowed all claims, recognizing the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention as claimed.
