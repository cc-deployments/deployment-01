# Apple Integration Strategy - June 5, 2024

## Immediate Action Plan (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Local Training Setup**
   - Begin with 40 pieces of art and JSON
   - Use existing Hugging Face/LLama architecture
   - Train locally while maintaining Apple compatibility

2. **Coinbase Smart Wallet Integration**
   - Target: Launch in 2 weeks
   - Integrate with local AI model
   - Prepare for initial user testing

## Architecture Migration Path
1. **Current Architecture** → **Apple Integration**
   - Hugging Face/LLama → Local Apple AI Training
   - Arweave Storage (Maintain)
   - React.js Frontend → Native iOS App

## Timeline
- Week 1: Local training environment setup
- Week 2: Initial model training (40 pieces)
- Week 3: Coinbase Smart Wallet launch

- Q1 2025: Full Apple ecosystem integration

## Key Decisions
1. Start local training immediately
2. Maintain Arweave for permanent storage
3. Prepare for Apple migration while developing
4. Keep architecture modular for easy transition

## Performance Goals
