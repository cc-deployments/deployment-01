# BANKR Token & Access Token Strategy - June 18, 2024

## Summary of Discussion

Today, we reviewed the legal, technical, and business implications of issuing a token to access our AI bot, referencing the latest industry guidance and the BANKR/CLANKER/Privy ecosystem.

### Key Points:
- **Token as Access:** Issuing a token (NFT or ERC20) to access the AI bot is feasible, but legal risk depends on design and marketing.
- **Legal Risk:** Utility tokens used strictly for access (not investment) have lower risk. Tradable, company-backed, or speculative tokens are more likely to be considered securities, especially for companies.
- **Custody:** Favor user self-custody (user wallets, reputable custodians like Privy or Coinbase). Avoid company self-custody unless protections and audits are in place.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Do not market the token as an investment.
  - Use non-tradable NFTs or access tokens for compliance.
  - If tradable, ensure robust legal review and compliance.
  - Clearly state the token's purpose in user-facing materials.
  - Implement on-chain verification for access control.
- **Airdrops:** If used, clarify that tokens are for utility/access, not profit.
- **Integration:** Embedded wallets (Privy, etc.) are suitable if custody and user protections are clear.

### Recommendation:
- For now, focus on NFTs or non-tradable access tokens for AI bot access.
- Avoid launching a company-backed ERC20 until regulatory clarity is achieved.
- Document all custody practices and review with legal counsel before launch.
