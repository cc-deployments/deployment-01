# Basename Migration Clarification

## üéØ Current Basename Situation

### What You Have:
- **carculture.eth** - Farcaster username (imported, currently posting from this)
- **carculture.base.eth** - Base basename (funds migrated, basename still on old wallet)
- **drivr.base.eth** - Base basename (owned by CarCulture.eth, not migrated yet)
- **L3ldrivr.base.eth** - Smart wallet address (`0x048a22DAB92f2c1e7Deb3847Ca151B888aAb0F1C`)

## üîÑ Basename Migration Process

### 1. **carculture.base.eth Migration**
**Status**: Funds migrated, basename still needs migration

**Process**:
1. Go to [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
2. Sign in with wallet that owns `carculture.base.eth`
3. Navigate to "My Basenames" ‚Üí find `carculture.base.eth`
4. Click three dots ‚Üí "Transfer name"
5. **Complete all 4 transactions** to fully transfer ownership
6. Transfer to: `0x048a22DAB92f2c1e7Deb3847Ca151B888aAb0F1C` (your smart wallet)

### 2. **drivr.base.eth Migration**
**Status**: Not migrated yet

**Process**:
1. Go to [base.org/names](https://base.org/names)
2. Sign in with wallet that owns `drivr.base.eth` (CarCulture.eth wallet)
3. Navigate to "My Basenames" ‚Üí find `drivr.base.eth`
4. Click three dots ‚Üí "Transfer name"
5. **Complete all 4 transactions** to fully transfer ownership
6. Transfer to: `0x048a22DAB92f2c1e7Deb3847Ca151B888aAb0F1C` (your smart wallet)

## ü§î Your Questions Answered

### Q: Will carculture.base.eth be migrated to smart wallet ever?
**A: YES, you should migrate it!** Here's why:
- You already migrated the funds
- The basename is still on the old wallet
- For consistency, migrate the basename to your smart wallet
- This gives you full control over both funds and identity

### Q: How will we migrate drivr.base.eth?
**A: Same process as carculture.base.eth:**
1. Use the wallet that owns `drivr.base.eth`
2. Go to base.org/names
3. Transfer to your smart wallet (`0x048a22DAB92f2c1e7Deb3847Ca151B888aAb0F1C`)
4. Complete all 4 transactions

## üéØ Recommended Migration Order

### Phase 1: Complete carculture.base.eth Migration
1. **Migrate basename** to smart wallet
2. **Set as primary name** on smart wallet
3. **Test functionality** to ensure everything works

### Phase 2: Migrate drivr.base.eth
1. **Migrate basename** to smart wallet
2. **Configure for DRIVR agent** use
3. **Test agent functionality** with new basename

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Transaction Requirements
- **4 transactions required** for each basename migration
- **Gas fees** will be needed for each transaction
- **Don't stop** after 1-2 transactions - complete all 4!

### After Migration
- **Set primary name** on smart wallet
- **Update environment variables** with new basename
- **Test all functionality** to ensure nothing breaks

## üîß Environment Variables to Update

After migration, update these:
```bash
# Primary basename for smart wallet
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIMARY_BASENAME=carculture.base.eth

# DRIVR agent basename
DRIVR_BASENAME=drivr.base.eth

# Smart wallet address
SMART_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x048a22DAB92f2c1e7Deb3847Ca151B888aAb0F1C
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Complete carculture.base.eth migration** (4 transactions)
2. **Set as primary name** on smart wallet
3. **Migrate drivr.base.eth** (4 transactions)
4. **Test both basenames** work correctly
5. **Update environment variables**
6. **Test DRIVR agent** with new basename

---

**Summary**: You need to complete both basename migrations to your smart wallet. The process is the same for both - just complete all 4 transactions for each one!
